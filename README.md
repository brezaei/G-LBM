## Training
1) Before running the train and test scripts, you have to save the motion masks of the videos by running the /utils/saveflows.py on the video datasets. We use [PyFlow](https://github.com/pathak22/pyflow) pipeline to compute optical flows fot generating motion masks.
2) Execute the code/train.py with proper input arguments to train the model on the dataset.


## Test
For running the trained model on eacch video execute the code/test.py by proper input arguments.
